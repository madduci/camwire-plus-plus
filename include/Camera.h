    Title: Header for camwire_1394.c

    Description:
    This module is about using a single named camera through its
    handle. The handle should be all a user need know about for complete
    access to all camera functions.  Finding cameras and assigning
    handles to them is done in the Camwire bus module.

   identical to one of the camera's ID strings (as may be obtained from

   string, or the model name string, or the vendor name string, in this
   order.  It first looks for the three filenames in the current working
   directory and after that in a directory given by the CAMERA_CONF
   environment variable.  The configuration file is cached the first
   time it is read by the current camera with handle c_handle.  There

   Setting state shadowing may result in faster camera responses and may
   increase robustness because the camera firmware is not interrupted by
   unnecessary status requests.  State shadowing may however be slightly
   risky because bugs in Camwire or in the camera firmware could cause
   the shadow state to differ from the actual state.  The state shadow

   *num_flashed.  *num_flushed will be less than num_to_flush if there
   were fewer buffered frames available to flush than requested.
   *num_flushed will never be more than num_to_flush.  It is safe to
   make num_to_flush a larger number than the total number of buffered
   frames.  If buffer_lag is not the null pointer, the number of bus
   frame buffers by which we are behind after flushing is returned in
   *buffer_lag.  This is the same number as can be obtained from
   camwire_get_framebuffer_lag().  *buffer_lag is only valid if

   flushed first.  Frames currently being transmitted by the camera are
   not affected.  Any frames accessed by camwire_point_next_frame() or
   camwire_point_next_frame_poll() should first be released with
   camwire_unpoint_frame() before flushing.  If you want to be sure of
   completely emptying all bus frame buffers, you should stop the

   valid for the camera.  The frame rates available may be constrained
   by the frame dimensions.  The actual frame rate set can be checked
   afterwards with camwire_get_framerate().  The meaning of 'frame rate'
   changes depending on the single-shot and trigger source settings.
   The frame rate determines how long frame transmission from camera to
   computer takes and how much bus bandwidth is used.  With internal
   trigger, non-single-shot (continuous), it is indeed the number of
   frames per second.  With external trigger, non-single-shot, it should
   be set faster than the external trigger frequency to avoid dropped
   frames.  With single-shot, it should be set faster than the frequency
   of single-shot requests.  Returns CAMERA_SUCCESS on success or
   CAMERA_FAILURE on failure. */

int camwire_get_shutter(const Camwire_handle c_handle, double *shutter);
/* Gets the camera's shutter speed (exposure time in seconds).  Returns
   CAMERA_SUCCESS on success or CAMERA_FAILURE on failure. */

int camwire_set_shutter(const Camwire_handle c_handle, const double shutter);
/* Sets the given shutter speed (exposure time in seconds) to the
   nearest valid value for the camera.  The actual value can be checked
   afterwards with camwire_get_shutter().  Returns CAMERA_SUCCESS on

/* Gets the relative gain factor (response slope) of the camera, as a
   number between 0.0 (minimum) and 1.0 (maximum).  The user has to
   interpret the meaning of this relative gain in terms of the

   slope.  For example, if the camera specifies the minimum gain as a
   slope of 1.0 (0dB) and the maximum as 4.0 (12dB), then the actual
   gain is (4.0 - 1.0)*gain + 1.0.  Returns CAMERA_SUCCESS on success

/* Sets the gain factor (response slope) to the nearest value valid for
   the camera.  The gain can be checked afterwards with
   camwire_get_gain().  Gain values can range between the relative
   values of 0.0 (minimum) and 1.0 (maximum).  The user has to normalize
   the actual wanted gain to this range before calling
   camwire_set_gain().  For example, if the camera specifies the minimum
   gain as a slope of 1.0 (0dB) and the maximum as 4.0 (12dB), then the
   relative gain to set is (actual_gain - 1.0)/(4.0 - 1.0).  Fails if

int camwire_get_brightness(const Camwire_handle c_handle, double *brightness);
/* Gets the relative brightness (black level) of the camera, as a number
   between -1.0 (minimum) and +1.0 (maximum).  The user has to interpret
   the meaning of this relative brightness in terms of the individual
   camera's specification of its minimum and maximum settable
   brightness.  For example, if the camera specifies the minimum
   brightness level as 0 and the maximum as 1023, then the actual
   brightness level is (1023 - 0)*(brightness + 1.0)/2.0.  Returns
   CAMERA_SUCCESS on success or CAMERA_FAILURE on failure. */

   relative values of -1.0 (minimum) and +1.0 (maximum).  The user has
   to normalize the actual wanted brightness to this range before
   calling camwire_set_brightness().  For example, if the camera
   specifies the minimum brightness level as 0 and the maximum as 1023,
   then the relative brightness to set is 2.0*actual_brightness/(1023 -
   0) - 1.0.  Fails if the brightness is not settable.  Returns

/* Gets the white balance levelss (blue or U, red or V) for colour
   cameras.  bal contains relative numbers between 0.0 and 1.0,
   corresponding respectively to the minimum and maximum levels
   implemented by the camera.  Returns CAMERA_SUCCESS on success or

   correction.  So far Camwire supports gamma in AVT cameras only.

   non-linearly compresses the camera's 10 or 12-bit internal data path
   into 8 bits per pixel component, according to the Rec.709
   specification.  To use gamma, the current pixel coding should
   therefore have 8 bits per component (such as CAMERA_PIXEL_MONO8,

   the Rec.709 specification.  This should only be used to linearize the
   response of images that were captured while gamma correction was
   enabled with camwire_set_gamma().  It should restore the image
   sensor's 10-bit (or so) linear dynamic range at the expense of some
   loss of resolution.  The size and pixel coding of the image pointed
   to by cam_buf must match the current setings of image size and pixel
   coding.  The current pixel coding should have 8 bits per component
   (see description of camwire_set_gamma()).  The resultant image
   pointed to by lin_buf must have the same image size, and an assumed
   pixel coding with 16 bits per component such as CAMERA_PIXEL_MONO16
   or CAMERA_PIXEL_RGB16.  The image in lin_buf therefore requires
   twice as much allocated memory as the one in cam_buf.  All 16-bit
   camwire images are in network (big-endian) byte order.  The max_val
   argument scales the output to give the wanted saturation value when

   buffer.  If a frame is ready it returns immediately, otherwise it
   waits until a frame has been received.  All 16-bit camwire images are
   in network (big-endian) byte order.  Note that this function may
   never return to the calling program if a frame does not become
   available, for example if the camera is not running or an external
   trigger does not arrive.  The frame buffer is locked, which prevents
   it from being overwritten by subsequent frames.  The calling program
   may freely read and write the buffer.  If more than one frames are
   buffered when this function is called then buf_ptr points to the
   earliest frame.  If buffer_lag is not the null pointer, the number of
   bus frame buffers by which we are behind is returned in *buffer_lag.

   always return a frame pointer, this function always returns to the

   its behaviour is similar to camwire_point_next_frame().  Note that
   the values returned from camwire_get_framenumber() and

   camwire_unpoint_frame() should be strictly interleaved, otherwise the
